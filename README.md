# Java-Examples

## Overview

This is a repository for examples that I've coded for purposes of learning Java and best-practices.

The best way to learn is by doing, and although I would normally try to find battle-tested open-source, I can use the code here for the purpose of using it as a reference or basis for building more exotic data types in the future.

## RadixSort

A clever algorithm that can sort faster than O(n * log(n)).
